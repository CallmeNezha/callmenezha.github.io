Hello, and welcome to my modest corner of the web!

This blog began in 2023 as a personal online journal, 
it mostly contains technical, programming-related posts. 
It's my way to document things I find interesting for my future self.

The contents of this blog reflect my personal opinions only; 
writing the posts and the programming explorations accompanying them are done in my free time. 
I never write on behalf of my employer in this blog. 
As a policy, it also doesn't contain paid writing assignments and I don't accept "guest posts" 
from others.
