Designing a new protocol and implementing it with maximum scalability is nontrivial, we need to consider these rules.

## Understand the needs of your communication scenario

By comprehending the specific requirements and objectives of the communication, you can tailor the protocol to meet those needs effectively. Here are some key aspects to consider:

1. Communication Goals: Determine the purpose of the communication. Are you transferring data, controlling devices, or exchanging messages? Clarify the goals and objectives of the protocol to ensure it aligns with the intended functionality.

2. Participants: Identify the entities involved in the communication. Are there clients, servers, peers, or a combination? Understand their roles, responsibilities, and the types of interactions they will have.

3. Communication Model: Determine whether the communication will follow a client-server model, peer-to-peer model, or another model entirely. This will influence the design decisions regarding message flow, addressing, and data exchange.

4. Network Environment: Consider the characteristics of the network environment in which the protocol will operate. Is it a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN)? Are there specific constraints like limited bandwidth, high latency, or unreliable connections?

5. Security and Privacy Requirements: Evaluate the security and privacy needs of the communication scenario. Determine if encryption, authentication, or other security measures are necessary to protect data and ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

6. Performance Considerations: Understand the performance requirements, such as throughput, latency, and scalability. Consider whether the protocol needs to be optimized for efficient data transfer or real-time interactions.

7. Error Handling and Reliability: Assess the importance of error handling, fault tolerance, and reliability in the communication scenario. Determine how errors will be detected, reported, and recovered to ensure robustness and resilience.

8. Interoperability: If the protocol needs to interact with existing systems or protocols, consider compatibility and interoperability requirements. Determine if there are any standard protocols, formats, or APIs that need to be supported.

9. Extensibility and Future Proofing: Anticipate potential future requirements and ensure the protocol design allows for flexibility and extensibility. Consider mechanisms for versioning, backward compatibility, and accommodating future enhancements.

> Don't design the wire protocol and transport layer protocol entirely by your self, it is important to leverage existing popular protocols and standards whenever possible.Go and see how popular protocols like JSON-RPC, XML-RPC, HTTP, SSH works. They fit your demands on transport layer well most of time. These established protocols have been widely adopted, thoroughly tested, and proven to be effective in various communication scenarios. And they provide a solid foundation and can save significant development effort.

## Commmon key patterns of design

When designing and implementing computer network sessions, there are several common patterns that are often followed to ensure efficient and reliable communication. Here are some of the key patterns:

1. Client-Server Architecture: This is the most common pattern where one system (the client) initiates a request to another system (the server), which then processes the request and sends back a response. The client and server can be on different machines or on the same machine.

2. Peer-to-Peer Architecture: In this pattern, multiple systems (peers) communicate and collaborate with each other without a centralized server. Each peer can act as both a client and a server, sharing resources and data directly.

3. Request-Response Model: It involves a client sending a request to a server, and the server responding with the requested data or performing the requested action. This pattern is widely used in web applications, where clients send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses.

4. Publish-Subscribe Model: Also known as pub/sub, this pattern involves a publisher that sends messages to a topic or channel, and multiple subscribers who receive those messages. It is commonly used in messaging systems, event-driven architectures, and real-time data streaming.

5. Stateful Sessions: In some scenarios, it is necessary to maintain session state between the client and server. This is achieved by establishing a session identifier or token that is used to associate subsequent requests from the client with the correct session state on the server. This pattern allows for maintaining context and preserving data across multiple requests.

6. Connection-Oriented Communication: In certain cases, establishing a persistent connection between the client and server is beneficial. This pattern reduces the overhead of repeatedly establishing and tearing down connections for each request. Protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provide reliable, connecti√üon-oriented communication.

7. Message-Oriented Communication: This pattern involves exchanging discrete messages between the communicating entities. Each message contains the necessary information for processing, and there is no need for a persistent connection. Protocols like UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are commonly used for message-oriented communication.

8. Asynchronous Communication: Asynchronous patterns allow for non-blocking communication, where a client can send a request and continue its operation without waiting for an immediate response. The server processes the request and sends the response at a later time, usually through callbacks or event notifications.

These patterns can be combined and customized based on specific requirements and the nature of the application or system being developed. They provide a foundation for designing and implementing effective computer network sessions.

## Layer by layer implement

Implementing a network protocol layer by layer is a good practice. This approach, often referred to as the layered architecture or protocol stack, allows for modular and organized development of network protocols.
