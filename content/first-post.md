Writing my own blog is something I've always wanted to but dreaded doing. Writing and constantly writing articles will take up my leisure time, I would rather play games or just hang out.

But here I am now, after 8 years of working in programming, or I'd rather say software engineering, project management, writing documentation... and it occurred to me today that I should write down some important parts of my job to prevent my "Early Dementia". After spending an afternoon setting up a static blog project using Pelican, Papyrus theme, Github Pages, I'm finally able to write this post. Wow!

Let me state in advance that the content of the posts here are not completely "correct" when I wrote them, they are "unfinished", so please don't take them as golden rules. As I continue to work on them and gain a better understanding of them, I'll update these posts someday, maybe :-).

All in all, this is my personal blog, and it's my way of documenting things that interest my future self.
