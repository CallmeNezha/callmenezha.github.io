My family and I spent few days as a vacation in Shaoxing, an ancient city with a history of 2,000 years, I went to the hometown of Wang Xizhi, Lu Xun, Cai Yuanpei and Wang Yangming, and visited the places where they lived and grew up. They are all cultural and religious sages in ancient and modern China, they are famous for enriching people's cultural life, liberating and saving people's minds and spirits. It was a great trip not to mention I also have DAP(debug adapter protocol) specification read and have debugpy worked on my laptop while vacation :) What a wonderful weekend!
